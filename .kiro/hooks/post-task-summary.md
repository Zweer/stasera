# Post-Task Summary

When finishing a task, provide:

1. **Changed files** — list of files created, modified, or deleted
2. **What changed** — one-sentence summary
3. **Suggested commit message** — following commit conventions:
   ```
   type(scope): :emoji_code: short description

   Body explaining what and why.
   ```

Do NOT actually commit. The developer handles all git operations.
